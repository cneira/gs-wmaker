Notable changes:

### fix GNUstep menus

Making sure only one menu or popup is visible at a time.

### fix "Hide" application command for GNUstep applications

The Hide command did not work consistently across all applications because WMaker got confused about what windows belong to which application. 
New implementation uses wm_class and wm_instance to gather all relevant windows for an app.

### launch on startup

Use the same approach as the NextSpace is using by appending `-autolaunch YES` to the command line'

### align the UI look and feel to look the same as a GNUstep app

Use color and font configuration from the GNUstep libraries. Note that WMaker links directly to the GNUstep libraries now.

### launch GNUstep apps with a file dropped on top of its dock icon

When you drop a file from one GNUstep app (e.g. GWorkspace) onto another GNUstep app (e.g. TextEditor.app) which is sitting in your dock, launch it with that file. This did not work before because the WMaker did not known about NSPasteboard, now it does.

### Building with GNUstep

Make certain you have GNUstep installed and have sourced the GNUstep.sh file.  Once this is done you can install the enhanced features using build.sh.  This should install GNUstepLib (the library that integrates WINGs with GS) and then builds WINGs and wmaker.

The simplest way to get started is to do:

`./build.sh`

Happy Hacking...
